<Em> <Am> <D> <Hm> <C> <Am> <D> <H7>

<Em>          <Am>
    She never took the train alone
 <D>          <Hm>
    She hated being on her own
 <C>           <Am>
    She always took me by the hands
 <D>    <H7>
    And said she needs me

<Em>          <Am>
    She never wanted in love to fail
 <D>           <Hm>
    She always hoped that it was real
 <C>      <Am>
    She'd look me in the eyes
 <D>    <H7>
    And say "Believe me"

<Em>             <Am>
    And then the night becomes the day
 <D>           <Hm>
    And there's nothing left to say
 <C>           <Am>
    If there's nothing left to say
 <D>     <H7>
    Then something's wrong

~<Em>  <Am>       <D>                 <Hm>
~Oh, tonight, you killed me with your smile
~   <C>           <Am>     <H7>
~So beautiful and wild, so beautiful
~<Em>  <Am>       <D>                 <Hm>
~Oh, tonight, you killed me with your smile
~   <C>           <Am>     <H7>          <Em>
~So beautiful and wild, so beautiful and wild

<Em>           <Am>
    And as the hands would turn with time
 <D>             <Hm>
    She'd always say that she was mine
 <C>      <Am>
    She'd turn and lend a smile
 <D>   <H7>
    To say that she's gone

<Em>         <Am>
    But in a whisper she'd arrive
 <D>    <Hm>
    And dance into my life
 <C>       <Am>
    Like a music melody
 <D>       <H7>
    Like a lover's song

~<Em>  <Am>       <D>                 <Hm>
~Oh, tonight, you killed me with your smile
~   <C>           <Am>     <H7>
~So beautiful and wild, so beautiful
~<Em>  <Am>       <D>                 <Hm>
~Oh, tonight, you killed me with your smile
~   <C>           <Am>     <H7>          <Em>
~So beautiful and wild, so beautiful and wild

 <H>            <Em>
    Through the darkest night
 <H>          <Em>
    Comes the brightest light
 <H>        <Em>
    And the light that shines
 <H>   <Em>
    Is deep inside
 <H>     <Em>
    It's who you are

~<Em>  <Am>       <D>                 <Hm>
~Oh, tonight, you killed me with your smile
~   <C>           <Am>     <H7>
~So beautiful and wild, so beautiful
~<Em>  <Am>       <D>                 <Hm>
~Oh, tonight, you killed me with your smile
~   <C>           <Am>     <H7>          <Em>
~So beautiful and wild, so beautiful and wild
